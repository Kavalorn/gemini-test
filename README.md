# INFO FOR REVIEWER

to change api url change variable REACT_APP_API_URL in .env at the root

hello dear reviewer of this task!

unfortunately i wasn`t made it as i wanted, but everything should work as expected.
i know, not so fancy, but still not so bad for such amount of time.
Table looks as it looks (according to the image) because i wanted to make it more generic. And didnt finished in time with styles.
later commits looks uglyer because i was in a hurry, have some duties, and want to sleep sometimes, you know :)

this project was made with create-react-app so you may run this project with this
1. install nodejs (worked with last LTS 16.17)
and from root directory of the project:
2. npm install
3. npm run start
4. you will see url in the terminal after start.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
